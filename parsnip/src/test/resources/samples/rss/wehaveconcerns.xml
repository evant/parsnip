            <description>The Bill Gates Foundation has funded research on an implantable
                remote-controlled contraceptive microchip that can last up to 16 years. Anthony and
                Jeff try to wrap their minds around the ramifications of a long-lasting birth
                control device that can be controlled by an app, and do their best to avoid putting
                their feet in their mouths about woman's issues.

            <description>A crow recently passed a remarkably complicated, eight stage intelligence
                test, which required it to perform a number of actions in a specific order to unlock
                a morsel of food. Jeff and Anthony are impressed by the problem-solving capabilities
                of the crow, and wonder what that means for the general cognitive ability of the
                animal kingdom. Also, are we gonna have to fight birds now?

            <description>An article in the New York Times outlines a series of studies which seem to
                point to the fact that empathy is actually a choice. Is there a benefit to feel
                something for our fellow man, or could it possibly be an evolutionary drawback,
                limiting our ability to make dispassionate decisions for the greatest good? Anthony
                and Jeff compare their own levels of empathy and try to decide what to feel.

                of an actual Brock: Brock Leads, a young man from the UK who was playing on a cliff

            <description>In this episode, recorded in front of a live audience at the NerdMelt
                Showroom in Los Angeles, Anthony and Jeff wrestle with their feelings after seeing
                the results of an experimental Chinese medial procedure. A factory worker in the
                Hunan province would have lost his hand after it was sliced off in an industrial
                accident - if not for the fact that surgeons re-attached it to his leg and allowed
                it to live there for a month while his wound healed enough for it to be grafted back
                onto his arm. It is a disturbing image, but is it a reassuring concept?

            <itunes:summary>Sonja Lang has created the world's smallest functional language. Her
                creation, Toki Pona, contains only 123 total words, and holds simplicity as its
                highest ideal. Jeff is enamored by language and charmed by the idea of designing one
                from scratch to fulfill a specific aesthetic, while Anthony is frustrated by the
                lack of nuance and potential for confusion. Together, they attempt to communicate
                what makes for great communication.

            <description>For the last ten years, a man in the UK has been waking up every day
                thinking it is March 14th 2005, the day he was scheduled to receive a root canal.
                Anthony and Jeff think this sounds like something out of a romantic comedy, but stop
                to consider what it might actually be like for the man and his family. Could it ever

            <description>A new paper, published in the Journal of Sensory Studies, attempts to

            <description>Monarch butterflies make an incredible, multi-generational migration from
                Canada to Mexico, but, strangely, they do not take the the most direct route.
                Somewhere over Lake Superior, these butterflies always change direction drastically,
                as if avoiding something. New research suggests that there was once a mountain range
                in the exact position of the course correction, and every generation of monarch
                butterfly somehow remembers to circumvent it, even thousands of yours later. Jeff
                and Anthony are mystified by this phenomena, but that doesn't stop them from
                speculating on how and why this unnecessary extra effort takes place.

            <description>New bionic implant has been developed that can replace the human eye lens.
                If approved, the surgery would take only 8 mins and give the recipients 3x 20/20

            <description>Back in 1999, Sony released a robot dog called Aibo. Now, 15 years later,
                these toys have started to break down, and Sony has ceased repairing them or
                manufacturing new models. This has caused the few people who still use and care for
                these little robotic companions to come to terms with the loss of a wholly inorganic
                member of their families. Jeff and Anthony discuss whether man-made friends can ever
                truly replace natural ones, and why we must always accept the inevitable death of
                all cute things.

            <description>In an effort to create a more accurate image recognition system,
                researchers have been training Google's neural network to pick out objects obscured
                by denser and denser layers of optical noise. But by feeding the AI the other
                direction - giving it nothing but noise and asking it to pick out images - they've
                discovered a surreal and dreamlike quality in the network that is both beautiful and
                haunting. Anthony and Jeff marvel at the ability for an AI to "dream", and project
                how this will lead to our ultimate downfall.

            <description>Scientists now believe that they have isolated the specific parts of DNA
                that cause aging in humans. Which leads Anthony and Jeff to think, if they've
                isolated them, perhaps they can eliminate them... And if they can eliminate them,
                can't we all live forever? And, like, if we can live forever... what would that
                mean?!

                human embryos. While these initial attempts to replace potentially fatal genes with
                new, safe, designer genes proved unsuccessful, the fact that Chinese researchers are

                March of 2011, Craig Lewis became the first human ever to live without a pulse.
                Anthony is eager to disregard his biological heart for science's improvements - he'd
                do it in a heartbeat - but Jeff is worried that living life without a pulse might
                lead to strange existence out of rhythm.

            <description>Moore's Law states that every 2 years the number of transistors on a chip
                will double. But some scientists predict that in just 10 years, we will hit the
                upper limit of Moore's Law. Anthony and Jeff wonder what the will happen if we get
                to the end of the Law and suggest a few ways we might outsmart this presumptive
                limit.

            <description>A group of biohackers is working on a way to create cheese without ever
                using an animal. The idea is to take custom-fabricated snippets of DNA and insert
                them into yeast to fabricate truly vegan cheese. In fact, they don't even need to
                use DNA from a cow. They could end up making human cheese. Jeff and Anthony debate
                the merits of dairy without the cow, and decide what kind of cheese they'd like

            <description>The Lujan Zoo outside of Buenos Aires has been dubbed the "World's Most
                Dangerous Zoo" because it allows visitors to cuddle, fondle, and feed lions, tigers,
                and bears. But when Anthony and Jeff hear about these practices, all they see are

            <description>A new study at USC shows evidence that men who are going bald may actually
                be able to stimulate their dormant follicles by violently plucking out the remaining
                hairs that do grow. This counter-intuitive solution was reached by ripping out fur
                in healthy mice, which leads Jeff and Anthony to wonder how far we as humans will go
                to regrow our hair, and what kind of doctor even thinks to try this.

            <itunes:summary>A 30-year-old Russian man Valery Spiridonov has volunteered to become
                the world's first head transplant. His terrible, degenerative spinal disease has
                forced him to resort to drastic actions, but some scientists are worried that the
                resulting neural confusion of a human head transplant may actually be worse than
                death. Jeff and Anthony wonder what kind of doctor would try such a thing, and
                consider the ramifications.

            <description>Cosmologist Fergus Simpson published a new scientific paper in which he
                suggests that intelligent aliens, if they exist, are likely enormous, weighing at

            <description>Researchers studying the movements of tarantulas in different climates have
                discovered that at higher temperatures spiders can actually move much faster. This
                is due to fluid in their joints becoming more viscous in high heat. The trade-off is
                that they also become more wobbly and out of control. Jeff and Anthony imagine the
                hydraulic robots that might be created based on this information, and worry about
                running from them on a warm day.

                alchemy can treat.

                scorpion venom to fight deadly brain cancer through a new product called "Tumor

            <itunes:summary>A group of biohackers in Tehachapi, California have figured out a way to
                give themselves night vision by squirting a kind of chlorophyll analog called
                Chlorin e6 directly onto their eyeballs. Anthony is thrilled by this development and
                cannot wait to try it himself, while Jeff is disturbed by the solid black color the
                eyes take on, and the complete lack of medical oversight. Would you go full Riddick?

            <description>This year the annual haunted house in Waukegan, Illinois provided an extra
                terror for visitors after an elderly man passed away inside and was mistaken for a
                prop for nearly 2 weeks. Jeff and Anthony wonder what kind of haunted house is so
                good a real dead body goes unnoticed, and whether his ghost actually haunts the
                haunted house.

                clinic and rehabilitation center for injured squirrels, pigeons, and other

                one-way trips to the red planet to anyone willing to apply. But according to at
                least one high-ranking applicant, the entire endeavor looks like a scam. A flimsy
                selection process based on purchases and donations, zero actual training, and no
                plan in place for the technology required to leave Earth's atmosphere. The guys work
                through their feeling about being denied the option to die in space.

            <itunes:summary>Anthony and Jeff had such high hopes for Mars One - the non-profit
                offering one-way trips to the red planet to anyone willing to apply. But according
                to at least one high-ranking applicant, the entire endeavor looks like a scam. A
                flimsy selection process based on purchases and donations, zero actual training, and
                no plan in place for the technology required to leave Earth's atmosphere. The guys
                work through their feeling about being denied the option to die in space.

            <description>It turns out the idea of human pheromones, tiny molecules that can attract
                a mate, or make you more likable, are a total fabrication invented to sell perfume.
                While pheromones do exist in goats and other creatures, there is no proof that human
                beings have them at all. Anthony and Jeff look into the strange, and surprisingly
                recent history of pheromone "science" and wonder how one company could
                single-handedly put a concept like that into the world.

                up with drunk revelers urinating on the sides of their buildings, so they turned to
                science to stop the behavior. Painting the most peed-upon areas with an extremely

                the numerous locations in the UK installing spikes in public places to get rid of

            <description>With a headline like "Man Gets Bionic Eye, Sees Wife for the First Time in

            <description>A very special 100th episode of We Have Concerns, recorded in front of a
                live audience at the Nerdmelt Showroom in Los Angeles! Anthony and Jeff discuss the
                potential to sell your feces to science for use in treating patients with C diff.
                Donors can earn up to $13,000 per year for their excrement, but the standards are
                quite high for what constitutes sellable poop.

            <itunes:summary>A very special 100th episode of We Have Concerns, recorded in front of a
                live audience at the Nerdmelt Showroom in Los Angeles! Anthony and Jeff discuss the
                potential to sell your feces to science for use in treating patients with C diff.
                Donors can earn up to $13,000 per year for their excrement, but the standards are
                quite high for what constitutes sellable poop.

            <description>A new article on i09 describes animal behaviorist John Calhoun's quest to
                create the perfect mouse city, complete with abundant food, recreation, and even
                rodent apartments. Now referred to as the "Behavioral Sink", the utopian underground
                mouse habitat quickly degraded into an apocalypse, as the mice turned on one another
                and the bloated population died out. Anthony and Jeff can't help but see parallels
                to modern life, but also take a moment to consider what kind of guy spends his time
                attempting to perfect rat cities.

            <description>According to researchers at Macquarie University, couples in long-term
                relationships develop inter-connected memory systems. Each partner can remember only
                a few details, but together they piece together a more accurate whole, ostensibly
                off-loading parts of the job to the other. Anthony is intrigued by this, and what it
                means for replacing human interaction with machines, while Jeff wonders how much can
                just be attributed to laziness and coincidence.

            <itunes:summary>According to researchers at Macquarie University, couples in long-term
                relationships develop inter-connected memory systems. Each partner can remember only
                a few details, but together they piece together a more accurate whole, ostensibly
                off-loading parts of the job to the other. Anthony is intrigued by this, and what it
                means for replacing human interaction with machines, while Jeff wonders how much can
                just be attributed to laziness and coincidence.

            <description>A Venezuelan man had his face surgically altered to look like the Red Skull
                - Captain America's arch-nemesis in Marvel Comics. His nose was removed, his brow
                was enlarged, his skin was reddened, and even his eyeballs were tattooed black. Jeff
                thinks this is horrifying and has very bad implications for the man's state of mind.
                Anthony thinks we only get one shot at life and if this makes him happy, so be it.
                Both of them wonder what his kid must go through at school.

                online advocating for abolishing the term "Content Creator" for people who release

            <description>A new study finds that men who interact with women during the fertile
                period of their menstrual cycle tend to be more creative with their grammar. Anthony
                is impressed that human "peacocking" extends into speech patterns, while Jeff is
                just amazed that men can pick up on when women are most fertile.

            <description>A group of researchers studying the effects of alcohol on speech decided to
                get some birds drunk. They divided a group of zebra finches - birds that learn and
                produce sounds similar to humans - into two groups. One sipped pure juice and the
                other a mixture of ethanol and juice. The results may shock you. Or not. Jeff and
                Anthony wonder how a group of researchers can spend grant money intoxicating birds,
                and why the fact that they slur their tweets is news to anyone.

            <description>A review led by a brain scientist at MIT found growing evidence that brain
                scans can predict future behaviors. If, one day, we are able to simply scan our
                brains to determine what kinds of activities we are more inclined to excel at, or
                problems we may encounter, will that lead to a healthier, more adaptive populace, or
                one shackled to in-born tendencies? Anthony and Jeff wrestle with that question, and

            <description>A court in Argentina just upheld an animal rights group's request to have
                an orangutan appear in a court, saying it's illegal to hold 'non-human persons' in
                cages. Whoops, apes are people now. So is this a good thing? How smart are animals?
                What sort of rights should they have? Also: what kind of animal skin makes the best
                sneakers?

                Singapore, is attempting to record odors digitally, and recreate them without the

            <itunes:summary>Adrian David Cheok, the founder and director of the Mixed Reality Lab in
                Singapore, is attempting to record odors digitally, and recreate them without the
                use of chemicals. While a breakthrough in the area is still a long way off, the idea
                of digital smells has Jeff and Anthony wondering what this technology could possibly
                be used for, and, moreoever, what working in a place called the Mixed Reality Lab"
                might be like.

            <description>Scientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York have
                successfully implanted human glial cells into the brains of mice to shocking result.
                Not only were the cells not rejected, but the human cells completely dominated the
                mouse brain cells. More incredibly, this led to mice which demonstrated a much
                higher capacity for memory and cognitive skill. Yep, Anthony and Jeff are thinking
                what you're thinking: the age of super-intelligent mice is upon us, and it is only a
                matter of time before we are all doomed. Listen as the guys bid farewell to the
                human race.

            <description>According to quantum physics, Planck's Constant is the smallest unit of
                measure in the universe, beyond which nothing can be further divided. Scientists at
                the Fermilab are building a Holographic Interferometer, or Holometer, with which
                they intend to test this theory. If true, it could mean that our entire dimension is
                a hologram, projected into 3D space like a pixelized image on your computer screen.
                Heavy stuff, but Jeff and Anthony wonder if it is cause for existential crisis or if
                it would even really matter. Of course, that's exactly what holograms would say.

            <description>An NPR story about NBC's Peter Pan Live television event points out that a
                significant portion of the audience of major TV hits are people who self-identify as
                "hate-watching" the programming. In fact, some networks are even programming to take
                advantage of these tendencies, embracing the live-tweeters who mock and add snide
                comments to the viewing experience. Jeff and Anthony have a major problem with the
                idea of "hate-watching", but also both enjoy a great bad movie. Are they hypocrites,
                or is there a difference between ironic enjoyment and vicious mockery?

            <description>Researchers from the University of Southern Denmark have synthesized
                crystalline materials that can bind and store oxygen in high concentrations. That
                means that we may be able to use crystals to replace oxygen tanks or even allow
                divers to simply draw oxygen directly out of H2O through the crystal. Anthony has
                always wanted to breathe underwater, but Jeff is worried about sucking on crystals
                for more than good vibes.

            <description>An open source group has recreated the brain of a worm, neuron for neuron,
                and recently programmed this data into the body of a Lego Mindspring robot. Rather
                than dictating specific behavior into the software, the program simply fires each
                neural imulse exactly as a worm's brain would. The result is remarkably worm-like
                behavior in Lego form. While Jeff can't exactly pin down the size of this creation,
                he is excited about what it means, but Anthony is worried worm-behavior is a low bar
                for judging artificial brains.

                Anthony can't believe it. Jeff tries to figure out the motivation behind such a

                enough to make them jump off a roof without an inflatable helmet.

                Researchers have just created the world's most precise atomic clock- but what do we
                get out of it? Isn't time just a human construct? What does 'precise' even mean in a
                universe where time changes depending on where you are? All of this kinda freaks
                Jeff out. Anthony, for once, isn't too worried about the nature of time.

            <description>The Foodini is an example of the new wave of 3D printers for food. Just
                fill it with fresh ingredients, and out pops meals like ravioli, pizza, and
                hamburgers, ready to cook. Anthony detests the tyranny of food, and doesn't have
                time for anything that stands in the way of productivity and effeciency. Jeff, on
                the other hand, can't wait to eat delicious meals shaped like all sorts of things,
                and sees a world where design and artful presentation is decoupled from a food's
                original form.

            <description>Scientists studying the brain's ability to make choices note that the fewer
                inconsequential decisions you put in front of yourself, the better you'll do when it
                is time to face a really challenging one. Armed with that knowledge, many prominent
                deciders like President Obama and Steve Jobs removed the decision of what to wear
                from their lives. They simply wear the same clothes every day. Anthony and Jeff
                wonder if wearing a uniform for life might be beneficial, what that outfit might
                look like, and how comfort fits into the equation.

            <description>Jeff is intrigued by an interview he read about Nasa's one and only
                Planetary Protection Officer. Her job? To protect OTHER planets from us and ensure
                the galaxy isn't contaminated by microbes, particles, or other detritus that might
                ruin it. Anthony hopes for the same attention to detail in his own life, and
                everybody hopes we don't ever accidently create avacado creatures.

            <link>http://wehaveconcerns.simplecast.fm/episodes/8051-a-tough-pill-to-swallow</link>
            <description>Researchers at MIT have developed a new pill that is much more efficient at
                delivering medicine into the bloodstream. Instead of a simple spheroid, it is
                covered in a multitude of tiny spikes, which stick into the stomache lining and
                ensure the medicine is absorbed rather than passed through the body undigested. Jeff
                is fascinated by the evolution of the swallow-able tablet, from its roots thousands
                of years ago to the more common "friable" form introduced in the 19th century - but
                Anthony wants no part of swallowing spike-balls. Beware the Spike Lobby.

            <description>A new article describes the benefits of long-form reading and suggests that
                the tactile feedback of printed books results in better retention than e-readers.
                While Jeff and Anthony are definitely on board with reading, they challenge the idea
                that enjoying books on digital screens is any less effective.

            <itunes:summary>A new article describes the benefits of long-form reading and suggests
                that the tactile feedback of printed books results in better retention than
                e-readers. While Jeff and Anthony are definitely on board with reading, they
                challenge the idea that enjoying books on digital screens is any less effective.

            <description>On this special Halloween episode, Anthony and Jeff consider the nature of
                of the trick or treat tradition and the urban legend of poisoned Halloween candy. Is
                asking strangers for food an inherently unsafe activity, or did we manufacture a
                scare that isn't real?

                episode Anthony mocked Jeff's enthusiasm for a mind-bending new technology that
                indicated that hoverboards may, in fact be possible. Now, there is a new article on
                Engadget that describes a working prototype soon making its way onto Kickstarter.
                Does Jeff get the last laugh, hovering his way back into the future he's always
                wanted, or is Anthony still able to poke penny-sized holes in the dream?

            <description>A new article describes a study in which doctors told patients they would
                just be getting a shot of vitamins, but instead gave them something a thousand times
                more powerful. Whether these subjects thought something strange was happening or not
                depended entirely upon what the doctors told them they should expect. This leads
                Jeff and Anthony to wonder just how much impact our conscious mind can have on our
                reality, and whether or not we can use this to our advantage.

            <itunes:summary>A new article describes a study in which doctors told patients they
                would just be getting a shot of vitamins, but instead gave them something a thousand
                times more powerful. Whether these subjects thought something strange was happening
                or not depended entirely upon what the doctors told them they should expect. This
                leads Jeff and Anthony to wonder just how much impact our conscious mind can have on
                our reality, and whether or not we can use this to our advantage.

            <description>Anthony found an article that describes the community around the IBM Model
                M keyboard, a sublimely clicky keyboard that has spawned cult-like devotion and a
                second hand black market. It makes him consider our fetishization of things, and the
                ties to productivity they create. Jeff just thinks all those objects are yelling at
                him.

            <description>Researchers have discovered that employees are actually more content taking
                orders from a robot than a human being in the workplace. This prompts Anthony and
                Jeff to wonder what it might take to promote robots into middle management, what the
                perfect form factor for a boss-bot might be, and how companies might implement their
                new robo-supervisors.

                states, in 50 straight days. Anthony, on the other hand, thinks it is unhealthy,
                obsessive, and downright stupid to push your body to that extreme. Is this just the
                Brock Life pushing human abilities to new heights, or a crazy person receiving
                misplaced admiration for a self-destructive act?

            <description>Google's Auto Awesome will take the best areas of slightly different
                photographs and combine them into one new, never-quite-was best version. A new
                article suggests that this kind of artful interpretation of history may prove
                problematic when AI determines what parts of photos are important. Anthony argues
                that no photograph is a true depiction, while Jeff wonders if we will ever remember
                something accurately again.

                something really bad for today's youth - but Anthony is certain that it's a good

                on-demand mean no more shared cultural experience? And where does this leave Capt

                Is obedience less intelligent than independence? Is there a bias in measuring

                loading and unloading scrap metal, and Jeff and Anthony desperately want to try it

            <description>An article by Kevin Ashton proposes that saying "no" to things is vital to
                the creative process. Anthony and Jeff wonder why they have such a hard time saying
                "no" and what that might mean about them.

            <description>A new article suggests that the Oculus VR headset may be the first step to
                allowing people to truly experience what it is like to live a different kind of
                life. This could allow designers to create "empathy engines" whereby users may come
                to feel emotion for their fellow man in a virtual space. Anthony and Jeff think this
                is a great idea, especially if causes douchey diners to tip their wait staff.

                and Anthony hearing voices. Is technology making us crazy, or have alerts been
                messing with the human mind since the beginning of time?

            <description>In an attempt to better understand pop music, Dr. Lior Shamir created an
                algorithm that can correctly identify and track the Beatles artistic output over the
                evolution of their career. Now, the same technology is being used to predict whether
                songs, movies, and other entertainment will be popular, and could even replace
                creators altogether. Jeff is worried that an equation will never have the soul
                required to create true beauty, while Anthony is convinced all art can be reduced to
                math.

                exact same way when they are angry, and a new article examines several possible

                negative thinking, called defensive pessimism, might actually be more conducive to
                productivity and well-being than thinking positively. Anthony, of course, is all
                over this idea, and calls it pragmatic. Could expecting the worst actually be
                beneficial? What about if you're seven years old?

            <description>Anthony found an article explaining how astronomers gussy up space
                photography to convey the scope and beauty of the cosmos, and now he has to break it
                to Jeff that every image he's ever seen of the galaxy isn't really as rich and
                vibrant as depicted. Is it important for science to be strictly accurate, or does
                artistic license play into scientific method?

            <description>Researchers have now successfully transferred words from one conscious mind
                to another over long distances... is a sentence that is technically true, but the
                details of how they did it reveal that true telepathy is still a long way off. That
                doesn't stop Anthony and Jeff from proposing ways real telepathic communication

                into a profitable business prompts Anthony and Jeff to discuss dreams,
                responsibility, passion, and choosing the right career. Also, Sir Patrick Stewart's
                hidden love of crude oil.

            <description>There is evidence to suggest that a microbe that lives inside the human
                stomache may be the key to ending deadly peanut allergies. Indeed, the microbiome
                that each of us carries around all the time may have far more to do with our
                physical and mental health than previously realized. This makes Anthony and Jeff
                think twice about who they'd like to share bacteria with, and how exactly these
                microbes are getting into our bodies.

            <description>Several high profile colleges have teamed up to create a universal index of
                basic knowledge for robots. The theory is that robot brains will need to know how to
                process even the most elementary interactions with everyday objects, and one
                consolidated resource for this information could be used in all future robot AI. How
                are they doing it? Stock photos and YouTube. Anthony just hopes the plans include
                robot dogs, while Jeff worries that this may lead to a world of Minecraft-addicted
                robots.

            <description>When a monkey grabbed his camera in Indonesia, snapped the perfect selfie,
                and the photo went viral, British photojournalist David Slater assumed he'd make a
                pretty penny from the iconic image. But the in a 1,222 page report, the US Copyright
                Office just announced that any picture taken by an animal, plant, or deity is cannot
                be owned by man. This makes Anthony and Jeff wonder what kind of crazy photography
                is going on inside the US Copyright Office.

            <description>Researchers in California are planning to treat Alzheimer patients by
                replacing their blood with blood of young people. Even crazier, there is reason to
                believe it may work, since old mice have become healthier and more youthful when
                their circulatory systems carried the blood of younger mice. This, combined with the
                story of a jellyfish that can reverse its aging process when sick or injured, has
                Anthony and Jeff pondering the possibility of immortality. That, and the inevitable
                vampire grandpas who'll be stealing young blood to live forever.

            <description>Researchers have determined that individual ant colonies have their own
                distinct personalities, and that these personalities are shaped by their
                environments. This leads Jeff and Anthony to wonder if all animals have personality,
                and if humans might have personalities that are shaped by their environments, too.
                Also, only eat animals that are dicks.

            <itunes:summary>Anthony read an article that argues in favor to short attention spans,
                and tries to convince Jeff that multitasking is the next step of evolution for
                humans. To prove his point, he does the entire episode while watching The Croods.

                around on the Internet change your behavior? Do you need to absorb media to to be
                creative, or does bombarding yourself with stimuli reduce your productivity?

            <description>Trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) - the process of directly
                electrocuting parts of the brain to accelerate learning - causes Anthony and Jeff to
                debate the possibility of the human soul. If we are just a series of electrical
                impulses, does it even matter if we can all be Super Men? Also how badass would it

                Anthony try to figure out why we cling to the past so much.

            <description>Jeff and Anthony talk about Android Wear and wearable technology in
                general. Anthony is concerned he’s turning into one of those cranky old dads who
                never gets rid of his VCR because it ‘works perfectly fine.’ Jeff worries about his
                hummingbird feeder.

                The third of a few test sessions we recorded while developing the show.
